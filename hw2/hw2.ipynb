Using 3 methods of your choice from [scikit-dimension](https://scikit-dimension.readthedocs.io), estimate the intrinsic dimensionality of this data and perform dimensionality reduction to the intrinsic dimension $\\hat{d}$ and dimensions $2$ or $3$ for visualization purposes using manifold learning methods of your choice. Compare the performance of different methods, comment on their ideas.\n",
